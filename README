# ITPM Playwright Assignment 1

## Project Overview
This project is a Playwright-based testing suite designed to validate the functionality of the "Changathi: Thanglish to Tamil" transliteration tool. The tool converts text written in Thanglish (Tamil written in English script) into Tamil script.

## Features
- **Automated Tests**: Tests are written using Playwright to ensure the transliteration tool works as expected.
- **Test Cases**: Includes both positive and negative test cases to validate the tool's functionality.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Configured to run tests on major browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Human-like Typing Simulation**: Tests simulate human typing with delays to mimic real-world usage.
- **HTML Reports**: Generates detailed HTML reports for test results.

## Project Structure
- **tests/**: Contains all test files and test cases.
  - `testcases.ts`: Defines the test cases for the transliteration tool.
  - `thanglish-to-tamil.spec.ts`: Contains the Playwright test scripts.
- **playwright.config.ts**: Configuration file for Playwright.
- **playwright-report/**: Directory where HTML test reports are generated.
- **test-results/**: Directory for storing test result artifacts.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd itpm-playwright-assignment1
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

```

### Viewing Test Reports
After running the tests, you can view the HTML report:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Test Cases
The test cases are defined in `tests/testcases.ts` and include:
- **Positive Tests**: Ensure the tool correctly transliterates valid Thanglish inputs into Tamil.
- **Negative Tests**: Ensure the tool does not produce incorrect outputs for invalid inputs.
- **UI Tests**: Validate the user interface behavior.
